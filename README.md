## Quick Start

- [Download the latest release](https://github.com/coreui/coreui-free-angular-admin-template/)
- Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/coreui/coreui-free-angular-admin-template.git`

#### <i>Prerequisites</i>

Before you begin, make sure your development environment includes `Node.js®` and an `npm` package manager.

###### Node.js

[**Angular 20**](https://angular.io/guide/what-is-angular) requires `Node.js` LTS version `^20.19.0 || ^22.12.0 || ^24.0.0`.

- To check your version, run `node -v` in a terminal/console window.
- To get `Node.js`, go to [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

###### Angular CLI

Install the Angular CLI globally using a terminal/console window.

```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

### Installation

``` bash
$ npm install
$ npm update
```

### Basic usage

``` bash
# dev server with hot reload at http://localhost:4200
$ npm start
```

Navigate to [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200). The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

#### Build

Run `build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

```bash
# build for production with minification
$ npm run build
```

## What's included

Within the download you'll find the following directories and files, logically grouping common assets and providing both compiled and minified variations.
You'll see something like this:

```

## Documentation

The documentation for the CoreUI Admin Template is hosted at our website [CoreUI for Angular](https://coreui.io/angular/)

## Versioning

For transparency into our release cycle and in striving to maintain backward compatibility, CoreUI Free Admin Template is maintained
under [the Semantic Versioning guidelines](http://semver.org/).

See [the Releases section of our project](https://github.com/coreui/coreui-free-angular-admin-template/releases) for changelogs for each release version.

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 20.0.2.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
