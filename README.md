## Quick Start
- Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/Oliverla977/Cumplimiento-marco-legal.git`

#### <i>Prerequisites</i>
Before you begin, make sure your development environment includes `Node.jsÂ®` and an `npm` package manager.

###### Node.js

  
[**Angular 20**](https://angular.io/guide/what-is-angular) requires `Node.js` LTS version `^20.19.0 || ^22.12.0 || ^24.0.0`.

- To check your version, run `node -v` in a terminal/console window.

- To get `Node.js`, go to [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

###### Angular CLI

Install the Angular CLI globally using a terminal/console window.

```bash

npm  install  -g  @angular/cli

```

### Installation


``` bash

$  npm  install

$  npm  update

```

### Basic usage

  
``` bash

# dev server with hot reload at http://localhost:4200

$  npm  start

```

Navigate to [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200). The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

#### Build

Run `build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

```bash

# build for production with minification

$  npm  run  build

```

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:


```bash

ng  serve

```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash

ng  generate  component  component-name

```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash

ng  generate  --help

```

## Building

  
To build the project run:


```bash

ng  build

```
This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.
